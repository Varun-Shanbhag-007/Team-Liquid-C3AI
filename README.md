### Project Title
- Real-time anonymous COVID-19 mapping using SIR model simulation
- This project aims to provide users with a heatmap of the surrounding area showing the number of susceptible and infected people, leaving the user with the choice to enter or refuse to enter the premises.

### Motivation
- This project was built as an entry to the C3.ai COVID-19 Grand Challenge.

### How to use this project?
- This project is divided into 4 parts, the data preparation and model building, data visualization, simulation and the final results. <br/>
- To run this project, the data visualization and model folders contain all the data, data cleaning and preparation to get the parameters to run the simulation. <br/>
Since our final model is a SIR model, these folders contain all the code and data to get the required rates and parameters to effectively replicate real-world simulation. <br/>
The simulation and results folders contain the final outputs of this project.
