Project Title
Real-time anonymous COVID-19 <tracking> using SIR model simulation
This project aims to provide users with a heatmap of the surrounding area showing the number of susceptible and infected people, leaving the user with the choice to enter or refuse to enter the premises.

Motivation
This project was built as an entry to the C3.ai COVID-19 Grand Challenge.

How to use this project?
This project is divided into 3 parts, the data preparation, the model building and the simulation.



### ToDo for Animation:
- Quarantine infected people after 2 days of free roam
    - Doesnt seem practical
    - Need data or probability
- Plot SIR Graph(done) and terminate when infected = 0
- Use numbers from DS team -> Data Driven aspect


- Solution specific :
    - Private and Public Areas
    - Reject folks
